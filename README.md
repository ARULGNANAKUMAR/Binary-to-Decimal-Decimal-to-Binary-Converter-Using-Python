Binary to Decimal &amp; Decimal to Binary Converter Using Python
Hereâ€™s a Python program that provides both Binary-to-Decimal and Decimal-to-Binary conversion functionalities in a single menu-driven interface.
How It Works
Binary to Decimal Conversion:

The binary_to_decimal() function converts a binary string to its decimal equivalent using Python's int() function with a base of 2.
Decimal to Binary Conversion:

The decimal_to_binary() function converts a decimal number to binary using Python's bin() function and removes the prefix 0b.
Menu-Driven Interface:

The program repeatedly asks for user input, allowing them to choose either conversion type or exit.
